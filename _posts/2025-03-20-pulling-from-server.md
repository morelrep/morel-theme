### **✅ The Standard Git Pull Workflow**
1. **Fetch the latest changes** (but don’t apply them yet):  
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   ```
2. **Merge the updates into your local branch**:  
   ```bash
   git merge origin/main
   ```
   - This is **exactly what `git pull` does** (`pull = fetch + merge`).
   - If there are no conflicts, it updates only changed files.

### **🛠 When `git pull` Might Fail to Update Files**
1. **Local changes blocking the update** → Run `git status` first. If you have uncommitted changes, either:
   - Commit them:  
     ```bash
     git commit -am "Save changes"
     git pull
     ```
   - Or discard them if you don’t need them:  
     ```bash
     git reset --hard
     git pull
     ```

2. **Git thinks the files haven’t changed** → If `git pull` says “Already up to date” but files are outdated, force it to reapply the changes:  
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   ```

---

### **🚀 The Best Approach for You**
Try **just running `git pull` first**:
```bash
git pull
```
- If it works as expected → **Great, that’s all you need.**
- If it doesn’t update files again, **try `git pull --rebase`** before resorting to a hard reset.

**Would you like to set up a script that checks for updates and only forces a reset when necessary?** 🚀
